# 🏠 IoT Project: Home Automation using Raspberry Pi and Telegram Bot 🤖

This project is focused on implementing home automation using a Raspberry Pi as the CPU, Groove Pi as the integrating unit, and Telegram Bot as the user interaction unit.

We provide Python code enabling the CPU to receive instructions from users through a Telegram Bot and execute actions accordingly. The system also monitors surroundings for intrusions and sends alert notifications through Telegram.

## Setup

### 1. Raspberry Pi OS Installation
- [Install Raspberry Pi OS](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_full_armhf/images/raspios_full_armhf-2024-03-15/2024-03-15-raspios-bookworm-armhf-full.img.xz)
- Write the SD Card using Raspberry Pi OS application.
- Configure a hotspot or Wi-Fi credentials after writing the SD to enable the Raspberry Pi to connect to a network.
- Enable SSH.
- Access Raspberry Pi using SSH.
- Follow this video tutorial for easy setup: [Setup Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vCFP2jD1g)

### 2. Coding

1. Create a Python file and write the code on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Update the code accordingly and ensure you replace the BOT token ID, Chat ID, and API's token key file path (.json file) correctly.

## Execution

1. Ensure all components are working properly by using some testing codes before running the main code.
2. Verify that every component is connected correctly.
3. Run the Python code in the SSH terminal and test the model.

## Components Required

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Grove Pi
3. Grove LED
4. Ultrasonic Ranger
5. Grove Connectors/Grove Jumpers
6. An SD Card
